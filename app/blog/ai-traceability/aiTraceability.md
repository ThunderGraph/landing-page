# Responsible AI and Traceability in Systems Engineering

Traceability is emerging as a central concern for responsible AI, especially in the context of systems engineering. As AI becomes more deeply embedded in complex, safety-critical domains—such as aerospace, automotive, and healthcare—the ability to track requirements, data, and model decisions through the entire system lifecycle is moving from a best practice to a necessity.

## The Role of Traceability in Responsible AI

Traceability means the ability to follow the lineage of requirements, data, and decisions from their origins through to implementation and outcomes. In systems engineering, this is not just about compliance; it's about ensuring that every component and decision can be justified, audited, and improved over time.

Recent trends in model-based systems engineering (MBSE) highlight why traceability is so critical. MBSE offers a structured approach to managing complexity, but it comes with significant upfront costs in process definition, infrastructure, and training. The payoff comes in later phases, where traceability supports early defect detection, risk reduction, improved communication, and standard conformance.

## Practical Challenges and Advances

The move to newer standards like SysML v2 is making traceability more manageable. SysML v2 improves requirements traceability and behavior modeling, and its textual models are easier to generate and integrate with AI tools. This opens the door to automating traceability, linking requirements to system elements and source documents as models are built and updated.

However, automating traceability is not without challenges. While large language models can help generate system models and references, issues remain around model verification, scalability, and preventing hallucinations. Ensuring that AI-generated artifacts are grounded in actual domain specific technical data is essential for trustworthy responses.

## Why Traceability Matters

- **Auditability and Accountability**: In regulated industries, traceability enables organizations to demonstrate compliance and investigate incidents by reconstructing the chain of decisions and data transformations.

- **Defect Detection and Risk Management**: Linking requirements through to implementation helps identify inconsistencies and gaps early, reducing downstream risk and rework.

- **Collaboration and Reuse**: Traceable models support better communication across teams and facilitate the reuse of validated components.

- **Adapting to Change**: As standards and regulations evolve, traceable systems can be more easily updated and audited.

## Our View of the Future

AI is beginning to automate aspects of traceability in MBSE, streamlining the connection between requirements, models, and documentation. While the technology is still evolving, the direction is clear: traceability is foundational for responsible AI in systems engineering. It supports compliance, transparency, and continuous improvement—qualities that are increasingly non-negotiable as AI takes on more critical roles in engineered systems.
